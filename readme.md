The state updated integration helper allows you to create sensors which monitor another entitys __state__ or __state_attributes__. This sensor requires at least two updates of the underlying sensor to establish a trend. Thus it can take some time to show an accurate state. It can be useful as part of automations, where you want to base an action on a trend.
